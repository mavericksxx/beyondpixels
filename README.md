This is a web application that generates images from textual descriptions using Hugging Face’s inference API. Simply input a text description, and the app will use AI to create a corresponding image.

Features

	•	Text-to-Image Generation: Users can input descriptive text to generate unique AI-generated images.
	•	Image Gallery: A carousel showcases previously generated images.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: A visually appealing, responsive UI with smooth transitions and animations.

Tech Stack

	•	Backend: Node.js, Express
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
	•	AI Model API: Hugging Face’s Inference API
